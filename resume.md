## About Me
* I'm a platform software engineer in Naver search department.
* Currently working as fullstack engineer, but I have more expertise in backend job.
* Settled CI/CD pipeline of every project, and implemented a robust testing strategy to ensure the reliability of the code.
* Have a strong point in cloud environment so I can make your legacy logic works in cloud.

## Experience

**Search Platform Software Engineer**
  ~ **Naver Corp, Republic of Korea**
  ~ **2015.12 ~ Present**

- **Developed Search Cloud Platform (ClouS)**
  - **Situation**: Naver search developers used physical server to serve search logic. When they operate like restoring failed server, it took lots of time and energy to do that.
  - **Task**: Make platform that can make and operate search service easily. And migrate from old platform's service to new one.
  - **Action**: As a fullstack engineer, developed service create, service list, Helmchart management, node management, server setting, manager setting, load balancer setting. And settled CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Result**: Released v1.0.0 in 2023.10. And developed lots of feedback features since then. Currently 5 search service work as the production mode. Other Naver search services will be migrated in no time. Saved half of every search developer's time because they don't have to operate their service like submitting form to get a new server or setting up logging and monitoring system.
  - **Tech Stack**: Kubernetes, Helmchart, Gin(Golang), Vue.js(Typescript), GraphQL, MariaDB, Quasar, ArgoCD. Github action, Cypress.
  - **Duration**: 2yr ~ present

- **Developed Search CI/CD Builder platform (CitruS)**
  - **Situation**: Naver search developer maintained their own CI/CD pipeline before. I suggested this platform to save their time.
  - **Task**: Make CI/CD builder platform.
  - **Action**: Made create wizard. It involves docker image setting, Jenkins setting, Sonarqube setting.
  - **Result**: Naver search developer can make their own CI/CD pipeline within a few minutes. Saved at least 2 hours of every developer's time. And saved server maintenance costs because I used centralized Jenkins and Sonarqube.
  - **Tech Stack**: Gin(Golang), Vue.js(Typescript), Django(Python), MariaDB, Bootstrap, Wetty, Jenkins, Sonarqube, Kubernetes
  - **Duration**: 1yr+

- **Developed Search Golang Library (GoSAS)**
  - **Situation**: Naver search engine team only offers C++ library. I wanted to use other modern languages when making search logic for productivity.
  - **Task**: Wrap Naver search engine library, so search developers can leverage modern languages like Go lang.
  - **Action**: Wrapped term extractor, synonym finder, ebool parser part. Changed automatic machine language type to Golang slice, map. Set CI/CD pipeline. Keep maintained when new search engine feature comes out.
  - **Result**: There is no significant performance drop when changing from C++ to Go. And developers can make their search logic 2 times faster compared to C++. I announced that result in Naver's Engineering Day workshop.
  - **Tech Stack**: Swig, Golang, C++
  - **Duration**: 1 yr+

- **Developed and Operated Post, Mail, Dictionary, App, Intellectual, Nboard, Naverme Search**
  - **Situation**: Naver search system needs constant care to maintain Top IT company position in Korea.
  - **Task**: Develop and operate important search service.
  - **Action**: Since I entered this company, developed Naver search service that I'm in charge of. And I applied unit test, e2e test for every pull request. I maintained the code library state of the art. Settled alarm and monitoring system and handled appropriately when something happens.
  - **Result**: Always meets deadline and doesnâ€™t have big failure in my service.
  - **Tech Stack**: Golang, C++, Apache module programming.
  - **Duration**: 8yr ~ present
